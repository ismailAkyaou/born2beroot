Virtual Machine:

A virtual machine is a software that is capable of running operating systems (aka guest machines) by using virtual hardware. That is made possible because the entire thing is hosted on a physical machine (aka host machine) that provides hardware resources for the VM. The software responsible for creating VMs is called the hypervisor. The hypervisor is responsible for isolating and managing (a middleware between the virtual and the physical world) the VM’s resources from the system hardware alas providing a closed sandbox for the VM that can mess with it without affecting the rest of the system, this is pretty convenient for testing malicious and or unstable softwares.

LVM (Logical Volume Manager):

LVM is an abstraction layer between a storage device and a file system. LVM provides a flexible experience while managing partitions (aka Logical Volume).

Physical Volume (PV): physical storage device.

Volume Group (VG): Partition group.

Logical volume (LV): Volume Group’s partitions.

AppArmor (Application Armor):

AppArmor provides a Mandatory Access System. MAS gives the system administration the ability to restrict the behavior that processes can perform.

APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) vs Aptitude:

APT is a CLI (Command Line Tool) tool that helps installing packages along with their dependencies. Aptitude on the other hand offers a GUI (Graphical User Interface) along with even more control over the package's dependencies.

SSH (Secure Shell):

SSH is a remote administration protocol that allows users to remotely control their machines over the internet.

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):

Provides to the system administration a simple way to manage the firewall without compromising security.

Cron:

A Linux task manager that allows scheduling running commands.

Wall:

A command that allows the system administration to send alerts to all the connected users.

Port:

A port is a gateway where connection can pass through for a specific service.

Firewall:

In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
